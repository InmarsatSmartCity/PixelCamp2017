## The challenge

### Context

Smart Cities and Connected Communities promise to improve citizen wellbeing. Inmarsat enables smart infrastructure, particularly in developing countries where there is a lack of adequate network connectivity. There is a wide choice of connected things available on the market which can be used to measure stuff in a city. So, we’ve deployed several pilot projects using our satellite and LoRa LPWAN networks with off-the-shelf sensors. But we have a general problem, we haven’t yet found a way to really improve peoples’ lives in the city.

### Possible use cases

  ─	Roads and traffic – Congestion to poor quality (potholes)  
  ─	Environmental Pollution – Vehicle Emissions, Cooking Fires to Industrial exhaust  
  ─	Public Safety – Police/emergency response times  
  ─	Emergency Response – Emergency communication, rapid deployed response to re-establish order

### LoRaWAN technology

LoRaWAN™ is a standard adopted by the LoRa Alliance and defines the communication protocol and system architecture for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). 

 

Networks are designed from the bottom up to optimize for battery lifetime, capacity, range, and cost and to support a major portion of the sensors and applications connected as the Internet of Things (IoT) that are needed to send small amounts of data over long distances, a few times per hour from varying environments.

LoRa® is the physical layer (or modulation technique) utilized to create long range communication links.

End-Nodes (sensors) can be associated with one or many gateways and use single hop bi-directional wireless communications to connect to gateways.
LoRa® gateways are deployed within a long range star network architecture as multi-channel, multi-modem transceivers that can demodulate on multiple channels simultaneously and demodulate multiple signals within a channel simultaneously. A gateway functions as a transparent bridge and will forward the received packet from the end-node to a cloud-based network server via some backhaul (cellular, Ethernet, satellite, Wi-Fi).

Inmarsat Satellite technologies functions as a singular network on a global scale and is used consistently to backhaul data - typically collected within remote regions where traditional terrestrial networks are lacking and/or unreliable. Additionally, as a singular operator, Inmarsat removes the burden to deal with multiple carries across geographical dispersed regions and countries.

The Network Server manages the data intelligence and network complexity and will filter redundant received packets, perform security checks, schedule acknowledgments through the optimal gateway, and perform adaptive data rate management (ADR enables capacity scalability). In the event that an end-node is mobile, no handover is required from gateway to gateway, a critical feature to enable asset tracking applications (a major target application for IoT).
