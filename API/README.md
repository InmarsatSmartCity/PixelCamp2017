# Data access

To access data generated by sensors, an API is provided.

The API is discribed and accessible at https://doc.eliot.in/inmarsat_pixels_camp/

An API key will be provided to the participants by inmarsat team.

## Data format

Datasets are available in 2 formats :

### eliot format

eliot is inmarsat's partner fieldcloud platform used to learn by experimenting with the internet of Things.

To facilitate access to data, informations received by the platform are formated in a standard way, no matter who provides it. 

For known sensors, payload are transformed to give easy to understand information such as temperature or passages.

To access those data, use the GET /data/{device_id} method where device_id correspond to DevEui or serial of the object (ask inmarsat team).

### Native

To access original dataset sended by inmarsat's platform, use the GET /data/{device_id}/original method.
